- ### COALA (Horizon 2020 Project)
This research aims to provide a solution for cognitive assistance that consists of a composition of trustworthy AI components with a voice-enabled digital intelligent assistant as an interface.

- ### Using Computer Vision to Measure Quality of Hand Hygiene
This research aims to detect the hand surface coverage with antiseptic products after hand hygiene by environmental sensors, such as infrared (thermal) cameras and RGB (Azure Kinect) cameras.

- ### Using Ubiquitous Sensing to Detect Episodes of Hand Hygiene
This research aims to detect and track episodes of handwashing and handrubbing by wearable sensors, such as inertial measurement units and electromyography.

- ### Using Environment and Calendar Data to Predict Emergency Admissions
The research aims to design a machine learning algorithm, which can be used to predict emergency department admissions through environment data, calendar variables, and history admission records.
