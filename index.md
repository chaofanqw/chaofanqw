Hi there! I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering, TU Delft, working on deploying conversational agents in industrial settings ([COALA](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/957296)).

My research focus is on human-computer interaction, ubiquitous computing, and medical informatics. Especially, I am experienced in applying machine learning algorithms to process wearable and environmental sensor data (IMU, sEMG, RGB camera, depth camera, and thermal camera) for activity recognition and image segmentation.

Before joining TU Delft, I completed my Ph.D. on “automated monitoring of hand hygiene quality” at the School of Computing and Information Systems, the University of Melbourne, advised by [Prof. Vassilis Kostakos](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/vkostakos/) and [Assoc. Prof. Jorge Goncalves](https://www.jorgegoncalves.com/).

Feel free to [contact me](/websites/contact) in case you have interest or questions regarding my work.
